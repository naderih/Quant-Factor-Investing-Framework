    "# Notebook 2: Time-Varying Factor Exposures\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "This notebook constructs the **time-varying Factor Exposure Matrix ($X_t$)**, a critical input for a dynamic multifactor risk model. This \"Project Titan\" version implements a professional-grade process for building robust, point-in-time factor exposures. For each month in our sample period, we will calculate a full cross-section of exposures based on data that would have been known at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is a large panel dataset where each row represents a specific stock at a specific point in time, and each column represents that stock's exposure to a fundamental factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methodology: Point-in-Time & Composite Factor Construction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology focuses on creating a robust and realistic `X` matrix by incorporating two key professional techniques: point-in-time data handling and composite factor construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **1. Industry Factor Classification:** I classify each stock into one of the 12 Fama-French industry groups based on its historical SIC code. This creates 12 orthogonal \"dummy variable\" factors that will form the basis for capturing market-wide and sector-specific risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **2. Composite Style Factor Construction:** We build our style factors using a **multi-descriptor composite approach**, as recommended by Grinold & Kahn for model robustness. This involves:\n",
    "    *   **Descriptor Calculation:** We first calculate the raw, underlying data (\"descriptors\") for each factor. This includes:\n",
    "        *   **Value:** Book-to-Market (B/M) and Earnings-to-Price (E/P).\n",
    "        *   **Momentum:** 12-month and 6-month historical returns (skipping the most recent month).\n",
    "        *   **Size:** The natural logarithm of market capitalization.\n",
    "        *   **Financial Constraints:** The Whited-Wu (WW) Index, which itself is a composite of several accounting ratios.\n",
    "    *   **Point-in-Time Lagging:** To avoid lookahead bias, accounting-based descriptors (like Book Equity and Earnings) are appropriately lagged to simulate real-world reporting delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **3. Cross-Sectional Standardization:** This is the core of the process. **For each month in our sample**, I perform a **capitalization-weighted standardization** on each of the raw style factor descriptors individually. This converts each descriptor into a comparable Z-score relative to the market *at that specific point in time*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **4. Final Factor Assembly:** The final factor exposures are created:\n",
    "    *   For composite factors (Value, Momentum), we take the **average of their respective standardized descriptors.**\n",
    "    *   The final composite factors are then re-standardized to ensure they have a clean, cap-weighted mean of zero and standard deviation of one. This creates pure, \"extra-market\" style factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts & Theoretical Justification**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Composite Factors for Robustness**\n",
    "\n",
    "A key principle from \"Active Portfolio Management\" is that relying on a single descriptor for a factor (e.g., only using Book-to-Market for \"Value\") makes a model fragile. Any single accounting ratio can be noisy, subject to measurement error, or misleading for certain industries (e.g., B/M for tech firms). By creating a **composite factor** from several related but distinct descriptors, we **diversify away the idiosyncratic noise** of each individual measure. The resulting factor is a more robust and stable representation of the underlying economic concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Time-Varying Exposures**\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies evolve. A firm can grow from a \"small-cap\" to a \"large-cap.\" It can transition from a \"growth\" stock to a \"value\" stock. By recalculating the standardized exposures for every period, our risk model can adapt to this evolution, providing a more accurate, forward-looking assessment of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Point-in-Time Data & Lookahead Bias**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lookahead bias is one of the most critical errors in quantitative research. It occurs when a model is built using information that would not have been available at the time of the decision. By carefully lagging accounting data to account for reporting delays, I ensure the factor exposures are \"point-in-time\" correct and our subsequent backtests are valid and realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Output:** This notebook generates and saves the `factor_exposures_titan.parquet` file. This panel dataset, indexed by `(date, permno)`, is the primary $X$ input for the Fama-MacBeth risk model estimation in Notebook 3.\n",
